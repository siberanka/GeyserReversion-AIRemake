GeyserReversion's GPL-3.0 terms are not replaced with an unrelated license.
The combined distribution also contains AGPL-3.0 Ouranos. GPLv3 section 13
and AGPLv3 section 13 govern this combination, including the network source
offer requirement. Server operators must prominently provide their users a
free corresponding-source link (including any operator modifications).

Source for each release is available alongside the JAR on both
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/siberanka/GeyserReversion-AIRemake/-/releases) and
[GitHub](https://github.com/siberanka/GeyserReversion-AIRemake/releases).
Use the `corresponding-source` asset: platform-generated archives do not expand
Git submodules. The asset includes the Ouranos sources/data, root sources,
compatibility patches and build scripts. Its build needs Java 21 and Internet
access to the Maven repositories declared in the build scripts. Dependencies
remain available under their own licenses and the source links above.
The `dependency-sources/` directory also contains exact-version source JARs
for the bundled StateUpdater libraries (LGPL-3.0) and Cloudburst Protocol.
Root/Ouranos build scripts can be adapted to relink modified dependencies;
there is no signature/installation restriction preventing such modifications.

Provenance: Ouranos upstream `e927ea497cae5a739acbf5d91f81024bf79738f0`,
BedrockData `5b9a844b20950395fcd2930f76701e6731568198`. Previous fork fixes are
preserved in root Git history; crafting preservation is carried forward as
version-aware ingredient/result conversion instead of untranslated IDs.

Inspiration only, not a claim of shared code: bundabrg/GeyserReversion.
